# RFI Response Automation Project


## Introduction
---------------

The RFI Response Automation project aims to develop an automated system for responding to Requests for Information (RFIs) in a timely and efficient manner. This project uses a combination of natural language processing, machine learning, and automation techniques to generate high-quality responses to RFIs.

## Project Overview
-------------------

* **Project Name:** rfi-response-automation
* **Description:** Automate the process of responding to Requests for Information (RFIs) using AI-powered tools.
* **Goals:**
	+ Improve response time to RFIs
	+ Enhance quality and consistency of responses
	+ Reduce manual effort and increase efficiency
  + Highlight the bennifits of Generative AI workflows

## Project Structure
---------------------

The project is organized into the following components:

* `docs`: Documentation and meeting notes related to the project
* `code`: Source code for the automation tool, including scripts and models
* `data`: Sample datasets used for training and testing the model
* `models`: Storage for models once the project is loaded

## Technologies Used
----------------------

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries and Frameworks:**
	+ TODO: Add as we go
* **Tools and Platforms:**
	+ GitHub for version control and collaboration
	+ SharePoint for project management and documentation
