    "## Chunking & Embedding\n",
    "Chunking is a significant decision to make in a RAG solution, here are some points to help understand why it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**\n",
    "- Improves retrieval precision by breaking down large texts into focused, contextually relevant segments\n",
    "- Optimizes computational efficiency and response times by reducing per-segment processing load\n",
    "- Maintains semantic integrity and reduces hallucinations through better context management\n",
    "- Enables better scalability and dataset maintenance through granular indexing\n",
    "- ptimizes token usage and associated costs within model context window limits\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Challenges**\n",
    "- Small chunks may lack sufficient context for coherent responses\n",
    "- Excessive fragmentation can increase computational overhead and API costs\n",
    "- Large number of small chunks can slow down search performance\n",
    "- Risk of breaking semantic relationships and natural language flow\n",
    "- May fragment logically connected information in specialized content (code, technical documentation)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use a simple recursive chunking strategy for simplicity-sake, but be aware there are more complex strategies that can take advantage of a given use case like for coding, powerpoints, etc."

       "Underdeveloped requirements can lead to unsatisfactory outcomes in federal contracts, limiting the ability to meet mission needs. The generation of appropriate pre-acquisition documentation has made IT acquisitions increasingly complex, creating challenges for business owners who may not be familiar with the nuance of developing requirements. Ultimately, poorly-written or incomplete pre-acquisition documentation (e.g. Statement of Objectives (SOO), Statement of Work (SOW), Performance Work Statement (PWS), market research, etc.) creates delays in the acquisition lifecycle. Department of State (DoS) program offices with IT acquisition needs require a solution incorporating statutory and regulatory considerations when building requirements documentation.\n",

       "5. Limited DoS IT acquisitions examples suitable for training data.\n",
